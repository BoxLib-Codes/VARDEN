# VARDEN

`Varden` is a variable-density incompressible hydrodynamics code built on
the `BoxLib` framework (the Fortran library).


## Getting Started:

To use `Varden` you need a copy of the `BoxLib` library, available
on github at:

https://github.com/BoxLib-Codes/BoxLib.git


## Mailing list:

`Varden` shares many simularities with the `Maestro` code, so questions about
`Varden` are welcomed on the `maestro-help` mailing list at google groups at:
